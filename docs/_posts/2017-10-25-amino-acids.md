## Role in Proteins and Life

Proteins are complex biological molecules responsible for the structure and function of everything necessary for life. Proteins are made of twenty different amino acids, which have three-letter and single-letter abbreviations.

1. alanine - ala - A
2. arginine - arg - R
3. asparagine - asn - N
4. aspartic acid - asp - D
5. cysteine - cys - C
6. glutamine - gln - Q
7. glutamic acid - glu - E
8. glycine - gly - G
9. histidine - his - H
10. isoleucine - ile - I
11. leucine - leu - L
12. lysine - lys - K
13. methionine - met - M
14. phenylalanine - phe - F
15. proline - pro - P
16. serine - ser - S
17. threonine - thr - T
18. tryptophan - trp - W
19. tyrosine - tyr - Y
20. valine - val - V

## Chemical Structure

![Alpha amino acid]({{ '/images/alpha-amino-acid.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Amino acids are made of an amine group (-NH_2), carboxyl group (-COOH), and R group (side chain) unique to each amino acid.

Amines are weakly basic organic compounds containing nitrogen. They are derived from ammonia (NH_3), with one or more of the hydrogens replaced by alkyl groups.

Carboxylic acids contain a carboxyl group (C(=O)OH).

In organic chemistry, the alpha carbon is the first carbon atom that attaches to a functional group. Subsequent carbons are named with Greek letters as well, e.g. beta carbon.

All protein-building amino acids are alpha-amino acids. Both their amine and carboxylic acid groups are attached to the alpha carbon.

Additionally, they are also all L-stereoisomers, or left-handed isomers.

## Classification by Polarity

Aside from the position of their functional groups, amino acids can also be classified by polarity, pH, and side chain type. Polarity is important for this project, so we'll examine that here.
